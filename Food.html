          <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil</li>
          <li>Beat the eggs in a medium  bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper, and set aside.</li>
          <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together.</li>

          <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>

          <li>Remove the garlic from the pan and discard it.</li>
          <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. when the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or a tongs and put it in the the frying pan with pancetta. Do not throw away the pasta water.</li>
          <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back  for sprinkling over later.</li>
          <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancentta of the heat. Quickly pour in the in the eggs and cheese. Using the tong or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixs easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated</li>
          <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
          <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta onto the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinking of the remaining cheese  and grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revivied</li> <h5>Cooking Tips</h5>
